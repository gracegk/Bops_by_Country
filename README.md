# Bops by Country Project

## Introduction 

The Bops by Country project attempts to explore the following questions, with data acquired from Spotify and Genius' web APIs. 

* Which characteristics are different for popular songs in USA and Taiwan (one of Spotify's first Asian markets)?
* Can we predict what kind of songs will be popular in USA and Taiwan?
* Do the popular songs in USA's charts share a similar sentiment?

## Methods

The project was created with RStudio Version 1.2.1335. 

Multilevel regression was used to predict what kind of songs would be popular in USA and Taiwan.
